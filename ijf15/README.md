# International Journalism Festival Highlights

15-19 April, 2015. Perugia, Italy.

I was on four panels at this enormous, highly regarded and very esteemedly attended conference. Iain and I tried to go to as many sessions as we could. And eat more Perugina chocolate than is recommended.


## Session Highlights

### [Why Structure is the Future of Journalism](http://www.journalismfestival.com/programme/2015/why-structure-is-the-future-of-journalism)

Laura and Chris Amico, formerly of Homicide Watch, were on this **fantastic** panel discussion along with Bill Adair of Duke University + Politifact and Alexios Mantzarlis of Pagella Politica. 

Bill is a ground breaker in bringing structured data to journalism, first using it on Politifact, which makes for more powerful ways of linking and relating different stories.

Other things structured data makes possible: [puts reader in charge, enabling easier, richer exploration](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCy41t3W4AIWFCZ.jpg:large); [allows sorting and tallying and even trend spotting, too](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCy41ipXIAARiJg.jpg:large).

"Beyond the headline and text" - panelists showed the typical "data structure" of news stories as a CMS entry form: the headline and the text blob are generally the two fields, along with, maybe, an author byline and/or section. 

They then contrasted that with all the fields you could specify, [using a Politifact report as an example](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCywDs1WIAA7E-i.jpg:large). Those fields will vary depending on story/medium, but that slide gives you the idea.

Laura Amico went on to describe her work at her new job, The Boston Globe. She wanted to see if reporters with no experience with it could do structured journalism. [Exhibit A: reporting the Boston Marathon bomber trial with data.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCyzsYFWYAAJZQX.jpg:large) [link to coverage](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/tsarnaev). This structured coverage is embedded with the rest of the Globe's reporting on the story as a timeline, including lists of witnesses and exhibits in each day of the trial.

Some of the challenges she faced:

* small, strict constraints on amount of info for each point
* finding the right technology/platform hard; they used google spreadsheets for ease of use and pervasiveness; reporters took notes directly in the spreadsheet
* getting the mission statement right: knowing what exactly are you trying to do w/structured data helps ensure you collect the right kinds of it
* figuring out the right workflow
* and of course, working with reporters to figure out how to report with data.

Next up was Chris Amico, who joined [Frontline](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/) as a news developer to push forward their investigative reporting through structured data. He highlighted a news app he created at Frontline along with an investigative reporter to track the changing landscape of voting rights in America: [Ballot Watch](http://apps.frontline.org/votingrights/). 

Each state gets to make laws surrounding who can vote, how and when. It's a complicated topic  that changes over time, depending on where you live. The challenge Chris saw was how best to cover this over the next six years, how to check the impact of changing laws on the audience. Using structured data, they were able to produce Ballot Watch, which breaks down voting rights into data points.

Alexios was also a great speaker, he made several of the slides I linked to along with the points I've condensed above. He was interesting as his background is in more "traditional reporting," not tech, and he's completely won over by this approach (where it makes sense of course).

Fragmented, complex stories can be presented to readers in more understandable ways with a database and an explanatory narrative.

A final, notable point the panelists made concerns CMSes, or whatever backend system you use to power any kind of structured journalism. There's a tension between having a very rigid set of fields and allowing narrative structured storytelling to have across a variety of stories. **Always leave at least one extra, miscellaneous field in your site-wide or project-specific CMS for the unexpected.**

The panelists have created [a google group dedicated to discussing structured journalism](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/structured-journalism) and encourage everyone interested to [join it](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/structured-journalism).

### [Africa as represented in the Western media: fallacies, approximations, omissions](http://www.journalismfestival.com/programme/2015/africa-as-represented-in-the-western-media-fallacies-approximations-omissions)

### [Social Media Verification Tools](http://www.journalismfestival.com/programme/2015/social-media-verification-tools)

Fergus Bell, head of newsroom partnerships and innovation at SAM, formerly head of UGC at the Associated Press, ran this entertaining and informative workshop on verifying stuff you find on social media.

**Verify the source. Verify the content.**

When you find a report on social media: 

* Review the person's history, on that platform and others. People often use the same username across several sites.
* Make contact: don't take someone's word for it. Ask them questions.
* Ask for permission. Whether it's policy or not: it's a way to build a case for verification.

* Seek separate confirmation 
* Consult independent experts: people who know the location, landmarks, history, etc.
* Translate text & audio.
* Establish context. Be transparent about verification process

### [The Unicorns of the Newsroom](http://www.journalismfestival.com/programme/2015/the-unicorns-of-the-newsroom)

This was the first panel I was on, and definitely the craziest in attendance: huge room, standing room only. I discussed how I got to be a programmer/journalist, aka a unicorn*, and went over some of the projects I was most proud of / recent work. [Aron Pilhofer](http://www.journalismfestival.com/speaker/aron-pilhofer), executive editor for digital at The Guardian and my former boss, discussed data journalism as well as some new projects only possible with "unicorns" at the Guardian. [John Crowley](http://www.journalismfestival.com/speaker/john-crowley), digital editor for Europe, Middle East and Africa at The Wall Street Journal, also described how reporters and techies/designers can and should work together while reviewing interactive and data-driven projects from the Journal. 

The big message? Silos are bad, get your news nerd developer/architects/designers into the newsroom, working with reporters, pronto.

* Yes, I was the token unicorn on the panel :D
